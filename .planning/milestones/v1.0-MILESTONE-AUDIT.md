## Integration Findings (Completed Phases)

**Result: 17/17 connections wired, 0 broken**

All cross-phase wiring between Phase 1 (infrastructure) and Phase 2 (parser tests) is correctly established:

| Connection | From | To | Status |
|------------|------|----|--------|
| FIXTURES object | tests/fixtures/index.ts | parser.test.ts, parser.error.test.ts, parser.smoke.test.ts | ✓ |
| SheetJS inline fix | vitest.config.ts server.deps.inline | All unit test XLSX imports | ✓ |
| Test glob | vitest.config.ts include | parser.test.ts, parser.error.test.ts, parser.smoke.test.ts | ✓ |
| Coverage scope | vitest.config.ts coverage.include | src/lib/parser.ts | ✓ |
| Fixture files (7) | tests/fixtures/generate.ts → *.xlsx | readFileSync in tests | ✓ |
| extractReferences export | src/lib/parser.ts:134 | parser.test.ts, parser.error.test.ts | ✓ |
| extractNamedRanges export | src/lib/parser.ts:86 | parser.test.ts | ✓ |
| buildExternalLinkMap export | src/lib/parser.ts:48 | parser.test.ts | ✓ |
| parseWorkbook export | src/lib/parser.ts:251 | parser.error.test.ts | ✓ |
| jsdom directive | // @vitest-environment jsdom (line 1) | parseWorkbook() FileReader test | ✓ |
| Playwright webServer | playwright.config.ts url:5173 | tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts | ✓ |
| E2E baseURL | playwright.config.ts baseURL | page.goto('/') | ✓ |
| Coverage HTML reporter | vitest.config.ts reporter | coverage/index.html | ✓ |
| fixtures:generate script | package.json | node tests/fixtures/generate.ts | ✓ |
| test script | package.json | vitest run | ✓ |
| test:e2e script | package.json | playwright test | ✓ |
| test:coverage script | package.json | vitest run --coverage | ✓ |

**Noted but not gaps:**
- `FIXTURES.large` and `FIXTURES.namedRanges` exist but are not yet consumed — by design, reserved for Phase 3+
- `tests/helpers/upload.ts` is a stub — intentional scaffold for Phase 4

---

## E2E Flow Verification (Completed Phases)

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Vitest unit test pipeline | `npm test` → config → 3 test files → parser exports → fixture files → 22/22 pass | ✓ Complete |
| Playwright E2E smoke | `npm run test:e2e` → playwright.config → Vite server → smoke.spec.ts → 2/2 pass | ✓ Complete |
| Coverage pipeline | `npm run test:coverage` → @vitest/coverage-v8 → coverage/index.html | ✓ Complete |
| Fixture regeneration | `npm run fixtures:generate` → generate.ts → 7 verified .xlsx files | ✓ Complete |

---

## Tech Debt

### Phase 1: Infrastructure

| Item | Severity | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| INFRA-01 requirement text says "jsdom environment" but implementation uses `node` environment — documented intentional deviation | Info | Update REQUIREMENTS.md text in v2 |
| `tests/helpers/upload.ts` is a stub scaffold for Phase 4 | Info | No action needed until Phase 4 |
| `FIXTURES.large` and `FIXTURES.namedRanges` generated but no tests consume them yet | Info | Will be used in Phase 3/4 |

**Total: 3 items, all Info severity, no action required before next phases**

---

## Unsatisfied Requirements Summary

**22 requirements orphaned** — all assigned to Phase 3 (GRAPH-01..07) and Phase 4 (E2E-01..15), neither of which has a phase directory or any plans.

This is expected state: the milestone is in-progress, not complete. The audit surfaces the remaining work clearly.
